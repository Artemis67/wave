Description: H2O Wave is a lightweight software stack for programming interactive web applications entirely in R (no HTML/Javascript/CSS) required. It is designed to make it fast, fun and easy to build low-latency, realtime, collaborative, web-based applications. It ships batteries-included with a suite of form and data visualization components for rapidly prototyping analytical and decision-support applications. Waveâ€™s components work in conjunction with the Wave relay server that facilitates realtime state synchronization between R and web browsers.
